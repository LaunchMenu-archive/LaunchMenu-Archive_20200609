short-term:
    // -test if the subIDS of mudles work properly

    // -make modules useable without registration
    // -only require class once a request for it has been made
    // -automatically load modules in the main thread
    -allow modules to run in a negative window number to run in a windowless thread

    -allow module handles to open in a specified element

    -add way of skipping an 'extends' in the chain of an requestModule

    -make config be able to declare whether:
        -The module can only be requested, but can't handle data
        -The module can only have its GUI embeded
        -The module can only have its GUI dockable
        -The module has any GUI
        -The module doesn't care where it gets instanciated

    -clean up code:
        // -turn from promises to async methods
        // -separate all classes into dedicated files
        // -consistently name classes
        -consider to pull apart front end and backend in classes
        // -properly comment all code
        // -properly type classes, fields and methods
        // -seperate setup methods and place at relevant areas

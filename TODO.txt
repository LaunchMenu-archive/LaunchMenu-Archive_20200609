short-term:
    // -test if the subIDS of mudles work properly

    // -make modules useable without registration
    // -only require class once a request for it has been made
    // -automatically load modules in the main thread
    -allow modules to run in a negative window number to run in a windowless thread

    -allow module handles to open in a specified element

    -add way of skipping an 'extends' in the chain of an requestModule

    -make config be able to declare whether:
        -The module can only be requested, but can't handle data
        -The module can only have its GUI embeded
        -The module can only have its GUI dockable
        -The module has any GUI
        -The module doesn't care where it gets instanciated

    //-Add the settings system to the module system

    -Test if making module's __getMethods method static improves performance

    -GUI system:
        -Make dockingContainers that can store and manage dockingElements
        -Make dockingElements that are resizable and moveable in their dockingContainer
        -Make tabContainers that can store an manage multiple tabs:
            -Make tab groups such that if GUI defines the same tab group, it will show up under the same tab and pop to the front when requesting focus
        -Make tabElements that can be put into these tabContainers
        -Make module GUI moveable, such that you can drag it into a specific tab, or to the side of a dockingElement, to create a new dockingElement
        -Get rid of Sass, and create an style helper module instead

    -clean up code:
        -Clean up the registry __request method to be less confusing
        // -turn from promises to async methods
        // -separate all classes into dedicated files
        // -consistently name classes
        -consider to pull apart front end and backend in classes
        // -properly comment all code
        // -properly type classes, fields and methods
        -update jsdoc such that async methods always return a promise of some type
        -seperate setup methods and place at relevant areas
        -make all method descriptions "verb phrases(?)" E.G. "opens a module", "loads the settings", etc
